The Story Behind This Decision

Hello everyone. First thing, a happy late new year, best wishes from me. I want to have a serious conversation with you about me, it's quite silent from my side lately and that has to do with a few things. I started with a new education that is way more difficult then I was hoping so I have to spend so much time into it then I was hoping so. Second thing, almost 1 month ago I had a car accident where I slipped out of a curve when it was slippery and I written off the complete front of the car but my car was my everything... I still have it difficult with that but the good news is I don't have any injuries, the other occupant have no injuries and the car will be fixed again but I have to fix a lot of stuff myself and that also ask a lot of time from me. Third thing, I have a new girlfriend and im really happy with her in my life, i've never felt this good with a person in my life and I don't want to lose her at all. But a small week ago I was on the point of a sort of mental breakdown, I had so much stuff in my head flying around that I have to do, I have to finish and not to forget that I said I have to do something about it before it goes to far. So I come to the following decision... I will discontinue Flex completely. I always did it for free with my free spare time. I did it with a lot of fun but now I don't have high priorities for it anymore so I have to let this fall right now and I will never continue with it anymore. Sorry that it has to go like this but always listen to yourself, that's the important thing in life to get a good and successful life and that's what I want to do right now. If anyone have questions for me please don't hesitate and ask them on Discord and I will answer them. Thanks everyone for the good 4 years this project lasted and a special thanks to everyone that contributed into this project! Love you all!
